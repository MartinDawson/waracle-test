run `yarn install`
run `yarn test` to run all unit tests
run `yarn start` to start the app

Things that can be improved:

- added error handling in multiple places, form, api etc.
- backend implemented properly.
- acceptance tests.
- unit tests added for the following files: editcake, savecake, cakeform. 
Reason for not adding these was that the time taken on this test was already long
and other unit tests proved capability in testing.
- use selectors and reselect for the memorization, perhaps for the conversion from Immutablejs array 
to normal array as that may be expensive.
- add local css or styled-components and styling to the page.
